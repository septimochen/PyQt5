set the QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable: to point to your site-packages/PySide2/plugins/platforms in order to successfully run that. This can be done from within Python too:

import os
>>> import sys
>>> from Qt import QtWidgets
>>> os.environ['QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH'] = os.path.dirname(PySide2.__file__) + '/plugins/platforms'
>>> app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)


or

create a qt.conf file in the folder of your python.exe with the content

[Paths]
Prefix = /dir_to_site-packages/PySide2
